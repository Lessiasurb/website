He’s so fucking talented it actually makes me sick. This poignant and powerful piece was a year in the making, hundreds of hours of work, brainstorms, tears and tantrums (the last two all me) incredible support, time and contribution from some ridiculously amazing people. Thank you to all of them, all our girls, our teams, our friends. Not to sound like we’ve won an Oscar but sickeningly I sometimes feel like it. Love you @paul.mclean1 you infuriate and inspire me every day, you’re my favourite feminist of all.

and we can only agree. The details in these numerous frames are composing a powerful visual message which underlines the conflicting assertions that a woman has to hear everyday.  
The words are clear. Nothing you do as a woman is, or will be, ever enough. That is why the message of this video should empower women to just follow their instinct and to stop listening others' judgmental words. Being a woman is not easy. We are judged from birth to death; we hear so much opinions about our bodies and behaviors, that we struggle to feel the freedom our society should be built upon.

> Let us hear this monologue, let us read it, share it, show it to everyone. Let us open our eyes as one unique community called humanity, and make these recurring phrases stop.

## "Be a lady, they said" by Camille Rainville

__Be a lady they said__. Your skirt is too short. Your shirt is too low. Your pants are too tight. Don't show so much skin. Don't show your thighs. Don't show your breasts. Don't show your midriff. Don't show your cleavage. Don't show your underwear. Don't show your shoulders. _Cover up_. Leave something to the imagination. Dress modestly. Don't be a temptress. Men can't control themselves. Men have needs. You look frumpy. Loosen up. Show some skin. Look sexy. Look hot. Don't be so provocative. You're asking for it. Wear black. Wear heels. _You're too dressed up_. You're too dressed down. Don't wear those sweatpants; you look like you've let yourself go.

__Be a lady they said__. Don't be too fat. Don't be too thin. Don't be too large. Don't be too small. Eat up. Slim down. Stop eating so much. Don't eat too fast. Order a salad. Don't eat carbs. Skip dessert. _You need to lose weight_. Fit into that dress. Go on a diet. Watch what you eat. Eat celery. Chew gum. Drink lots of water. You have to fit into those jeans. _God, you look like a skeleton_. Why don't you just eat? You look emaciated. You look sick. Eat a burger. Men like women with some meat on their bones. Be small. Be light. Be little. Be petite. Be feminine. Be a size zero. Be a double zero. Be nothing. Be less than nothing.

__Be a lady they said__. Remove your body hair. Shave your legs. Shave your armpits. Shave your bikini line. Wax your face. _Wax_ your arms. Wax your eyebrows. Get rid of your mustache. Bleach this. Bleach that. Lighten your skin. Tan your skin. Eradicate your scars. _Cover_ your stretch marks. Tighten your abs. Plump your lips. Botox your wrinkles. _Lift_ your face. Tuck your tummy. Thin your thighs. Tone your calves. Perk up your boobs. _Look natural_. Be yourself. Be genuine. Be confident. You're trying too hard. You look overdone. Men don't like girls who try too hard.

__Be a lady they said__. Wear makeup. Prime your face. Conceal your blemishes. Contour your nose. Highlight your cheekbones. Line your lids. Fill in your brows. Lengthen your lashes. Color your lips. Powder, blush, bronze, highlight. Your hair is too short. Your hair is too long. Your ends are split. Highlight your hair. Your roots are showing. Dye your hair. Not blue, that looks unnatural. You're going grey. You look so old. Look young. Look youthful. _Look ageless_. Don't get old. Women don't get old. Old is ugly. Men don't like ugly.

__Be a lady they said__. Save yourself. Be pure. _Be virginal_. Don't talk about sex. Don't flirt. Don't be a skank. Don't be a whore. Don't sleep around. Don't lose your dignity. Don't have sex with too many men. Don't give yourself away. Men don't like sluts. Don't be a prude. Don't be so uptight. Have a little fun. Smile more. Pleasure men. Be experienced. Be sexual. Be innocent. _Be dirty_. Be virginal. Be sexy. Be the cool girl. Don't be like the other girls.

__Be a lady they said__. Don't talk too loud. Don't talk too much. Don't take up space. Don't sit like that. Don't stand like that. Don't be intimidating. Why are you so miserable? Don't be a bitch. Don't be so bossy. Don't be assertive. Don't overact. Don't be so emotional. Don't cry. Don't yell. Don't swear. Be passive. Be obedient. _Endure the pain_. Be pleasing. Don't complain. Let him down easy. Boost his ego. Make him fall for you. Men want what they can't have. Don't give yourself away. Make him work for it. Men love the chase. Fold his clothes. Cook his dinner. Keep him happy. That's a woman's job. You'll make a good wife someday. Take his last name. You hyphenated your name? _Crazy feminist_. Give him children. You don't want children? You will someday. You'll change your mind.

__Be a lady they said__. Don't get raped. Protect yourself. Don't drink too much. _Don't walk alone_. Don't go out too late. Don't dress like that. Don't show too much. Don't get drunk. Don't leave your drink. Have a buddy. Walk where it is well lit. Stay in the safe neighborhoods. Tell someone where you're going. Bring pepper spray. Buy a rape whistle. Hold your keys like a weapon. Take a self-defense course. Check your trunk. Lock your doors. Don't go out alone. Don't make eye contact. Don't bat your eyelashes. Don't look easy. _Don't attract attention_. Don't work late. Don't crack dirty jokes. Don't smile at strangers. Don't go out at night. Don't trust anyone. _Don't say yes. Don't say no_.

__Just “be a lady” they said.__
