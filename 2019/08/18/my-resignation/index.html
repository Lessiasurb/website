I got along with my colleagues and reached my best skills.<br>Then I started to get angry. Communicate the problems in a nice way wasn’t working, so I ended up with 3 letters of resignation in 6 months. I have never given them to the manager, because I had a very good relationship with the team.<br>Then 3 months ago everything changed…</p><p>I used to love changes. They smelled like a new start, but this time was different: almost all the team resigned, and the stress raised.<br>My unhappiness grew a lot. So I decided to understand on my own, why I was sure to be miserable and not just lazy.</p><p>I made what I consider to be “a scientific research” about my behavior.</p><blockquote><p>My house is a dump</p></blockquote><p>I recently moved in with my boyfriend. He is not tidy at all, but he is making a lot of efforts. Now we are at a point where he has just some stuff around, while mine are everywhere. We don’t see the couch anymore. I stopped to clean after myself, the only rule I gave my boyfriend.</p><blockquote><p>I don’t cook anymore</p></blockquote><p>I like to cook, but it takes a lot of time, if you want to make some properly delicious dishes. So for work I used to do some fast cooking, and during my free time I used to make some elaborated food, because it was relaxing and made me feel accomplished. Now, my meals are expired sandwiches, ready salads from the grocery store or random food I can find.<br>I get a proper meal once a week thanks to my boyfriend cooking skills (how could I even find him?).</p><blockquote><p>I am mad all the time</p></blockquote><p>I used to be neutral. Open minded. It was my best characteristic.<br>Now I feel more aggressive, ready to fight for an opinion that is not right. I just “attack” everyone, or everything, just to be the one who wins without further discussions.<br>This is a new me, and I like to stand up for myself, since I used to be the “yes woman”.<br>On the other hand, I miss my peaceful approach to make people understand my point of view.</p><blockquote><p>I gained weight</p></blockquote><p>I was never skinny, slim, regular or how you like to say. However, I use to have a weight that makes me feel good in my skin. Stress, unhappiness, depression, bad feelings and so on… make me gain weight. Since I know myself a bit (27 years together with my soul, but I have still some doubts), I know that this is a bad sign: a message that my body is sending me.</p><blockquote><p>It’s time to get better</p></blockquote><p>This job taught me a lot, but on the other side I lost friends, time and important moments.<br>I gave all myself, maybe it was a mistake, but it’s done already.</p><p>I can’t get back.</p><p>I can look forward doing myself a favor and quit. I will “recover” and get my sh*t together, because that is what a grownup does (still need a confirmation about that too).</p><blockquote class="sign"><p>Alessia Sorbo<br><i><small>2019-08-18</small></i></p></blockquote></div><footer><div class="social"><div>Follow us on:</div><a rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/WritingAboutTs" target="_blank"><img src="/images/twitter.png" alt="Twitter"> </a><a rel="noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/lessiasurb" target="_blank"><img src="/images/instagram.png" alt="Instagram"> </a><a rel="noopener" href="https://linkedin.com/in/alessia-sorbo-13851011a" target="_blank"><img src="/images/linkedin.png" alt="LinkedIn"> </a><a rel="noopener" href="https://medium.com/@alessiasorbo" target="_blank"><img src="/images/medium.png" alt="Medium"> </a><a rel="noopener" href="https://facebook.com/WritingAboutThings" target="_blank"><img src="/images/facebook.png" alt="Facebook"></a></div><br><a rel="license,noopener" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target="_blank"><img alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0" src="https://licensebuttons.net/l/by/4.0/88x31.png"></a><br>This work is licensed under a <a rel="license,noopener" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a>.<br><br><a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a></footer><script>!function(){if(localStorage){var e=document.querySelector(".theme-switcher > input");if(e){switch(localStorage.getItem("theme")){case"dark-theme":e.checked=!0;break;case"light-theme":default:e.checked=!1}e.addEventListener("change",function(){localStorage.setItem("theme",e.checked?"dark-theme":"light-theme"),reloadTheme()})}}}()</script></body></html>
