If you don’t, congrats, you won against life. However my sticking period is lasting one year and is continuing.</p><blockquote><p>Why?</p></blockquote><p>Lack of confidence, doubts, laziness, and doubts again. But this year I got a boyfriend. He didn’t arrive in a package in front of my door, but HE found me or most correctly HE found my soul (dramatic music).</p><p>I didn’t know love, what it was, how to feel it, etc., but I discovered it with him.</p><p>He is nice looking, he is so confident while talking and, maybe, he is talking too much. I met him when he was hating himself and it seems like I helped him to find out how awesome he really is.</p><p>In my defense, it wasn’t such a big deal. However he wants to return the “favor”. He wants me to find a purpose. So he annoys me, every one or two days, to do something: to start writing, to be creative, bla bla bla. He is so cute while doing it.</p><p>We know each other more than one year and he is still trying to understand me. I think this is the real love.</p><p>I am lazy, and empty maybe (dramatic music).<br>Damn it, I am so lucky.</p><blockquote><p>In your face life!</p></blockquote><p>So he is annoying me.</p><blockquote><p>How?</p></blockquote><p>He is trying to instill his passions in me. It is not really working, since we are like the day and the night: he is a scientist and I am an artist, or something like that.</p><p>However, he succeeded convincing me to open a blog.<br>Let’s be clear: he is handling it, I am just “<em>writing about things</em>“.</p><blockquote><p>So here we are</p></blockquote><p>I am going to write, maybe once a week, about all the things that come into my mind. Still not sure if I am going to do it of my own free will, or thanks to my annoying boyfriend, but I guess it is a good start to fill up some soul holes (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhttZz9lmpk">dramatic music</a>).</p><blockquote class="sign"><p>Alessia Sorbo<br><i><small>2019-07-21</small></i></p></blockquote></div><footer><div class="social"><div>Follow us on:</div><a rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/WritingAboutTs" target="_blank"><img src="/images/twitter.png" alt="Twitter"> </a><a rel="noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/lessiasurb" target="_blank"><img src="/images/instagram.png" alt="Instagram"> </a><a rel="noopener" href="https://linkedin.com/in/alessia-sorbo-13851011a" target="_blank"><img src="/images/linkedin.png" alt="LinkedIn"> </a><a rel="noopener" href="https://medium.com/@alessiasorbo" target="_blank"><img src="/images/medium.png" alt="Medium"> </a><a rel="noopener" href="https://facebook.com/WritingAboutThings" target="_blank"><img src="/images/facebook.png" alt="Facebook"></a></div><br><a rel="license,noopener" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target="_blank"><img alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0" src="https://licensebuttons.net/l/by/4.0/88x31.png"></a><br>This work is licensed under a <a rel="license,noopener" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a>.<br><br><a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a></footer><script>!function(){if(localStorage){var e=document.querySelector(".theme-switcher > input");if(e){switch(localStorage.getItem("theme")){case"dark-theme":e.checked=!0;break;case"light-theme":default:e.checked=!1}e.addEventListener("change",function(){localStorage.setItem("theme",e.checked?"dark-theme":"light-theme"),reloadTheme()})}}}()</script></body></html>
